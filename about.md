Hi, I'm Talip from Ankara.I will share my personal interest and experiences about software development..
In general, I follow open source java libraries and use them in my daily business life.
I have been in the software sector since 2009 and now I am actively working as a software development manager in public projects in Neta≈ü.

I am using the current versions of each library and development framework we use, and my team. 
I am careful to keep up-to-date and I follow the software information sharing sites like github and stackoverflow with care. 
I follow the items titled SHOW HN in the hacker news on a daily basis.

I strongly recommend following these types of sites especially to young engineers and those who want to be aware of software development.
