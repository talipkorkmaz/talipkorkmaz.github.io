Hi, I'm Talip from Ankara.I will share my personal interest and experiences about software development..
In general, I follow open source java libraries and use them in my daily business life.
I have been in the software sector since 2009 and now I am actively working as a software development manager in public projects in Neta≈ü.

I am using the current versions of each library and development framework we use, and my team. 
I am careful to keep up-to-date and I follow the software information sharing sites like github and stackoverflow with care. 
I follow the items titled SHOW HN in the hacker news on a daily basis.

I strongly recommend following these types of sites especially to young engineers and those who want to be aware of software development.

<p>As a agile follower, I'm trying to follow the rules of extreme programming. I'm also interested in TDD/BDD.</p>
<p>I'm continuously learning about new software, libraries and applications that help us to construct stable, performing and reliable and scalable architectures.
	developing products and services for our customers by using open source java frameworks, creating and maintaining models and managing teams.</p>
<p>
	I'm specialized in Java development, more precisely in the development of APIs and backend applications, either using REST or SOAP endpoints.
	Also as a full stack developer I easily generate SPA's with bootstrap templates.
	In frontend, I used Jquery, Angular js and NodeJs.
	I also developed some android projects which are not in market.
</p>
<p>I have always worked using the Java ecosystem (Java, Scala, Groovy), but I also used another technologies in several projects.
	Languages as Shell Script,Perl,Python, C++ or JavaScript (NodeJs and Jquery and AngularJS).
	I have used relational databases and caching mechanisms as Memcached, Redis, Hazelcast, MongoDB and Couchbase.
	Also, I have experience about continous integration / delivery.</p>
